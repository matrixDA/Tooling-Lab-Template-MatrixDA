## Self-Reflection:

This project was an engaging experience in working with different tools to validate and verify my application. At first, the project was very difficult because I had a difficult time setting up eslinter and getting that to work properly. But after I had found what was wrong the process became much smoother. The only other problem I encountered was failing the folder structure test, my directory included more files like Webpack and Cypress that weren't on the test.

### How long it took me to finish this?

3.5 hours
